# Project Title

Coins.PH Cryptocurrency Price Tracker

# Motivation

I recently got into cryptocurrency and then I decided to create this web app. I created this web application for the sole purpose to track the current buy and sell prices for BTC, ETH, BCH, and XRP. I recently got in to Coins Pro(Closed Beta) an orderbook exchange which has lower fees than Coins.PH. The only good thing going for Coins.PH is the ease of buying crypto, and if you are still using using it to buy and sell, then this web app is for you.
